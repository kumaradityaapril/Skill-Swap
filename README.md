git clone <repository_url>
cd skillswap
```
**Frontend Setup:**

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
```
bash
    cd frontend
    
```
2.  Install dependencies:
```
bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    
```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add your environment variables (e.g., API base URL):
```
env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=<your_backend_api_url>
    # Add other frontend specific variables here
    
```
4.  Start the development server:
```

```
2.  Install dependencies:
```
bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    
```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secret, Nodemailer credentials, Twilio credentials, Cloudinary credentials):
```
env
    MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
    JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
    # Add other backend specific variables here (email, twilio, cloudinary etc.)
